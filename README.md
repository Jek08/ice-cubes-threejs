# A simple implementation of Three.js and Cannon.js Library

This project is created for learning how to make 3D object simulation using Three.js and use 3D physics engine, Cannon.js.
I make a random spawning cubes simulation. Those cubes interact by collision at each other.

Some inconvenience happening in the simulation is the motion of object that is not natural and there are some bugs, such as jumpy moves from object collision.
Maybe, Three.js is not really usable as game or simulation engine?
